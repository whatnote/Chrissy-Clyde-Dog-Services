## Project Summary

This project is my Milestone 1 coupled with a new site for my Partner's dog walking business. Due to covid-19, the world has changed; home working has meant the need for dog walking isn't what it once was, but their has been a steep increase in people and families getting dogs, espcailly puppies.

With this my partner, Chrissy, has taken to oportunity to retrain and up-skill her dog walking business and extend it to include puppy and dog training. Chrissy has completed one diploma, and to is now well underway in her dog behavoural diploma.

Once the new new normal is establish, the new online presence should prove a vital tool in finding new clients.

## Media

- Images are my own.
