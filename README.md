## Project Summary

This project is my Milestone 1 coupled with a new site for my Partner's dog walking business. Due to covid-19, the world has changed; home working has meant the need for dog walking isn't what it once was, but their has been a steep increase in people and families getting dogs, espcailly puppies.

With this my partner, Chrissy, has taken to oportunity to retrain and up-skill her dog walking business and extend it to include puppy and dog training. Chrissy has completed one diploma, and to is now well underway in her dog behavoural diploma.

Once the new new normal is establish, the new online presence should prove a vital tool in finding new clients.

## Content

- The copy is written by me, and at this stage is more as placeholder text than the finished article.

## Media

- Images are my own.
- documents used are either the geniun article of dummy versions if the orginal container too much infoamtion. Eg the Puiblic Liability policy doesn't provide a PL certificate in teh same way an Employer;s Liability policy does. The PL schedule details everything, including the premium paid and staff discount obtained. So I made the decision to provide the needed infomation.

- I'd also like to think my Partner Chrissy for putting up with the long nights infont of a computer
